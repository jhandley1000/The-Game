# The-Game
Repository for project 3

To use the collaborative aspects of github you will need an account and then to make a repository for this project. It's a bit of a learning curve to use git but it should be worth it.

I have uploaded Game-1.07.h (which we are thus far supposed to leave unedited and use for reference), and also testGame.c, which we are supposed to edit first. We will write the action struct in Game-1.07.h next but testGame.c comes first.

There are 21 functions in Game-1.07.h that we are supposed to write tests for. I would suggest that as there are 5 of us we each write 4 of these then work together on the test function for void disposeGame, as even Sahan could only think of testing for seg faults in order to test that one.

Easiest way I reckon is if we each take 4 in succession, so for instance I'll take the first 4: void makeAction, void throwDice, int getDiscipline, int getDiceValue (Game g, int regionID). Just edit this file with the 4 functions you'll take and we should be good.
